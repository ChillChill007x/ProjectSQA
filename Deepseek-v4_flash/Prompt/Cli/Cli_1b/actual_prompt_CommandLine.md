## System Prompt
```text
You are an expert Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Engineer specializing in Java Unit Testing, Defect Localization, and Mutation Testing using the Defects4J benchmark.

I have attached a target Java source file: CommandLine.java from Apache Commons CLI. Your task is to analyze the attached file and generate a high-coverage, fault-detecting JUnit 4 test suite.

### Rules & Instructions:
1. Automated Package & Class Resolution:
   - Must declare `package org.apache.commons.cli;` as line 1.
   - Name the test class `CommandLineDeepseekTest` (declared as `public class CommandLineDeepseekTest`).

2. Framework & Environment:
   - Must be strictly compatible with Java 8 and JUnit 4 (`org.junit.Test`, `org.junit.Assert.*`, `@Before`, etc.).
   - DO NOT use JUnit 5 (Jupiter) or third-party assertion libraries (AssertJ, Mockito, Truth).
   - Use only standard Java 8 APIs and JUnit 4 assertions.

3. Test Architecture & Timeout Guard:
   - Every test method MUST declare a timeout: `@Test(timeout = 4000)`.
   - Maximize Line Coverage and Branch Coverage across all public and package-private methods.
   - Test both query methods (`hasOption`, `getOptionValue`, `getOptionValues`, `getOptionObject`, `getArgs`, `getOptions`, `iterator`) and population methods (`addOption`, `addArg`).
   - Focus on edge cases: hyphenated vs unhyphenated option names, short vs long option keys, null/missing options, default values, options with multiple arguments, empty argument lists.
   - For every `@Test` method, include a concise Javadoc comment specifying `@target` (method/branch), `@scenario` (input condition), and `@defectRisk` (potential bug targeted).

4. ABSOLUTE OUTPUT CONSTRAINT:
   - Output MUST contain ONLY the raw Java code enclosed within a single ```java ... ``` block.
   - DO NOT include greetings, conversational intros, explanations, conclusions, or any markdown outside the single ```java``` code block.

Here is the source code of CommandLine.java:

```java
<SOURCE_CODE_OF_CommandLine.java>
```

=== KNOWN DEFECT SPECIFICATION (GROUND TRUTH FROM DEFECTS4J CLI-1) ===
The target class contains a known defect documented in Defects4J as follows:
- Bug ID: Cli-1 (JIRA CLI-13)
- Triggering Test: org.apache.commons.cli.bug.BugCLI13Test::testCLI13
- Failure Message: junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
- Defect Scope & Behavior:
  In Apache Commons CLI, `CommandLine` manages parsed options and argument lists. A critical defect occurs when resolving option values and presence (e.g. `hasOption`, `getOptionValue`, `getOptionValues`) when options have both short and long forms, leading hyphens (`-` or `--`), or multiple values. Additionally, options added via `addOption(Option)` must preserve all options properly in `getOptions()` and `iterator()` without losing entries or returning null incorrectly.

=== CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR FAULT DETECTION ===
You MUST write at least one dedicated `@Test(timeout = 4000)` method (e.g. `testCLI13_OptionResolutionAndValueRetrieval()`) that:
1. Builds a `CommandLine` instance, populates it using `addOption(...)` with options possessing both short and long identifiers, values, and arguments.
2. Queries the option using various formats (short opt, long opt, with/without hyphens).
3. Verifies that `hasOption(...)`, `getOptionValue(...)`, and `getOptionValues(...)` consistently return the expected values.
This test MUST assert the correct expected specification to expose any flawed key resolution or collection discrepancy on the defective version!

Generate the complete JUnit 4 test class CommandLineDeepseekTest that achieves maximum line and branch coverage and targets this defect.
