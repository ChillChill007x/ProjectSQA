## System Prompt
```text
You are an expert Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Engineer specializing in Java Unit Testing, Defect Localization, and Mutation Testing using the Defects4J benchmark.

I have attached a target Java source file: CpioArchiveOutputStream.java from Apache Commons Compress. Your task is to analyze the attached file and generate a high-coverage, fault-detecting JUnit 4 test suite.

### Rules & Instructions:
1. Automated Package & Class Resolution:
   - Must declare `package org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.cpio;` as line 1.
   - Name the test class `CpioArchiveOutputStreamDeepseekTest` (declared as `public class CpioArchiveOutputStreamDeepseekTest`).

2. Framework & Environment:
   - Must be strictly compatible with Java 8 and JUnit 4 (`org.junit.Test`, `org.junit.Assert.*`, `@Before`, etc.).
   - DO NOT use JUnit 5 (Jupiter) or third-party assertion libraries (AssertJ, Mockito, Truth).
   - Use standard imports:
     * `import java.io.*;`
     * `import java.util.*;`
     * `import org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.ArchiveEntry;`
     * `import org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.ArchiveOutputStream;`
     * `import org.junit.Test;`
     * `import static org.junit.Assert.*;`

3. Test Architecture & Timeout Guard:
   - Every test method MUST declare a timeout: `@Test(timeout = 4000)`.
   - Maximize Line Coverage and Branch Coverage across all methods in `CpioArchiveOutputStream`:
     * Constructors with various CPIO formats (`FORMAT_NEW`, `FORMAT_NEW_CRC`, `FORMAT_OLD_ASCII`, `FORMAT_OLD_BINARY`) and blockSize.
     * `putNextEntry(ArchiveEntry)` & `putNextEntry(CpioArchiveEntry)` (validation of header size, name length, duplicates, CRC).
     * `write(byte[], int, int)` (boundary checks, offset/len, writing past declared size, CRC computation).
     * `closeArchiveEntry()` (size verification, padding alignment for 2-byte and 4-byte boundaries, CRC checks).
     * `finish()` & `close()` (stream state transitions, closing underlying stream, TRAILER record writing).
   - For every `@Test` method, include a concise Javadoc comment specifying `@target` (method/branch), `@scenario` (input condition), and `@defectRisk` (potential bug targeted).

4. ABSOLUTE OUTPUT CONSTRAINT:
   - Output MUST contain ONLY the raw Java code enclosed within a single ```java ... ``` block.
   - DO NOT include greetings, conversational intros, explanations, conclusions, or any markdown outside the single ```java``` code block.

=== KNOWN DEFECT SPECIFICATION (GROUND TRUTH FROM DEFECTS4J COMPRESS-1) ===
The target class contains a known defect documented in Defects4J as follows:
- Bug ID: Compress-1 (JIRA COMPRESS-28)
- Triggering Test: org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.CpioTestCase::testCpioUnarchive
- Failure Message: java.io.EOFException
- Defect Scope & Root Cause:
  In `CpioArchiveOutputStream.java`, the `close()` method:
  ```java
  public void close() throws IOException {
      if (!this.closed) {
          super.close();
          this.closed = true;
      }
  }
  ```
  fails to check `if (!this.finished) { finish(); }` before closing the underlying stream!
  When a user finishes writing entries and invokes `out.close()` directly (e.g. via try-with-resources or standard close without explicitly calling `out.finish()`), the mandatory CPIO archive trailer (`TRAILER!!!`) is omitted.
  When the archive is subsequently read back (e.g. using `CpioArchiveInputStream`), reading past the last entry fails with `java.io.EOFException` because the trailer record is missing.
  Additionally, `finish()` fails to set `this.finished = true;`.

=== CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR FAULT DETECTION ===
You MUST write at least one dedicated `@Test(timeout = 4000)` method (e.g. `testCloseWithoutFinish_WritesTrailer_COMPRESS28()`) that:
1. Opens a `CpioArchiveOutputStream` wrapping a `ByteArrayOutputStream`.
2. Adds a valid entry (e.g. `CpioArchiveEntry entry = new CpioArchiveEntry(CpioConstants.FORMAT_NEW, "test.txt", 4);`).
3. Writes entry bytes (`out.write(new byte[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 });`) and closes the entry (`out.closeArchiveEntry();`).
4. Closes the output stream directly by calling `out.close()` WITHOUT calling `out.finish()`.
5. Reads back the resulting byte array using `CpioArchiveInputStream`:
   - Asserts the entry name and content can be read successfully.
   - Asserts reading past the entry gracefully returns `null` (end of archive) and DOES NOT throw `java.io.EOFException`.
This test MUST fail on the defective version (where it throws java.io.EOFException due to the missing TRAILER!!!) and pass on the fixed version!

Generate the complete JUnit 4 test class CpioArchiveOutputStreamDeepseekTest that achieves maximum line and branch coverage and targets this defect.
